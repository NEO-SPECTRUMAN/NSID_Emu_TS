SID player for ZX Spectrum with Turbo Sound (NedoPC standard)
<br/> TS engiine is still unfinished
<br/> it doesn't have 8580 duty tables yet
<br/> as well as many other features due to the heavy lack of memory
<br/> 
<br/> based on Simon Owen's SID Player v1.4 for SAM Coup√©
<br/> https://simonowen.com/sam/sidplay/
<br/> https://github.com/simonowen/sidplay
<br/> and molodcov_alex's simple port for ZX Spectrum
